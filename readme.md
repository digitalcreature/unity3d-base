# tgrehawi's unity3d shenanigans
this repo contains a bunch of starter/utility code that i like to use in unity3d projects.

## how to get
stable releases will be tagged, and will also be available as unity asset packages. maybe this'll be on the asset store? who knows

probably the best way to get it is to just fork the repo, or add it as a remote and merge it into an existing project. that way you can easily update using git, rather than finding the asset package and reimporting it each time
